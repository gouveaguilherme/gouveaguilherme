## Welcome to my GitHub!

Here I showcase my skills and share my passion for technology. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities for collaboration.

I'm studying Analysis and Systems Development and I'm always looking for new challenges to help me grow professionally. Right now, I'm focused on learning Python for back-end development and I'm also super into data analysis and cybersecurity.
My main goal is to create solutions that make people's lives better, and I'm always on the lookout to expand my tech knowledge.
